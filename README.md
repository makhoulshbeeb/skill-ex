> A web App for people to host meetings and exchange skills and talents.
>
> SkillEx is an innovative platform that connects people with different skills and talents, allowing them to exchange services without the need for money. Users can offer their expertise in various fields, such as graphic design, language tutoring, coding, or practically anything, and in return, receive help in areas where they need assistance. The app fosters a community of mutual support and learning, making skill acquisition and service access more affordable and collaborative.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to offer my graphic design skills in exchange for web development lessons, so I can build my own website without spending money on a developer.
- As a user, I want to see user ratings and reviews, so I can ensure I'm exchanging services with reliable and skilled individuals.
- As a user, I want to participate in community forums and groups, so I can network with other professionals and hobbyists who share my interests.
- As a user, I want to track the skills I've exchanged and received, so I can have a clear record of my transactions and progress.
- As a user, I want to set up virtual meetings and workshops, so I can learn and collaborate with others in real-time.

###  SkillEx is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
